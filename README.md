## 🎯 The Vision

YouTube AI Navigator transforms passive video consumption into active intelligence gathering. While other extensions simply wrap an LLM in a browser popup, we've engineered a **Context Engine**—a sophisticated orchestration layer that autonomously queries 10+ specialized APIs in parallel, synthesizing external knowledge into a unified context window that empowers Google's Gemini AI to deliver analysis rivaling human expert commentary.

**The Result:** Instant, deep, context-aware insights for any video. Zero cost. Zero friction. Zero compromise.

## 🏗️ Engineering Excellence

### Unbreakable UI Architecture

The user interface is engineered to survive the hostile environment of modern web applications:

**Self-Healing DOM Injection**
A dedicated `MutationObserver` monitors the YouTube sidebar 60 times per second. If the AI Widget is displaced, covered, or removed by YouTube's dynamic navigation, it is instantly re-injected at the top of the sidebar.

**Z-Index Supremacy**
Calculated stacking context (`z-index: 2202`) ensures the widget floats above all YouTube native elements, including playlists, transcripts, and advertisements.

**SPA-Aware Navigation**
The extension listens to YouTube's internal `yt-navigate-finish` events, handling soft navigations seamlessly without page reloads.

### Production-Grade Reliability

**Exponential Backoff Retry**

-   Automatically retries transient failures (rate limits, server errors, timeouts)
-   Configurable retry attempts with exponential delays (1s → 2s → 4s)
-   Fails fast on non-retryable errors (authentication, bad requests)

**Rate Limiting**

-   Token bucket algorithm prevents exceeding API limits
-   Gemini free tier: 15 requests per minute (RPM)
-   Request queuing when limit reached
-   Real-time statistics tracking

**Timeout Protection**

-   All API calls have configurable timeouts (default 30s)
-   Prevents hanging requests from blocking the extension
-   Uses `AbortController` for clean cancellation

**Error Classification**

-   Distinguishes between retryable and fatal errors
-   Provides user-friendly, actionable error messages
-   Structured logging for debugging

### Performance Optimizations

**Parallel Execution**
Context Manager fetches 10+ APIs simultaneously using `Promise.allSettled`, ensuring zero latency impact from sequential operations.

**Request Caching**
Previously analyzed videos return instantly from local storage, eliminating redundant API calls.

**Service Worker Keep-Alive**
Prevents Chrome from terminating the background script during long operations, ensuring uninterrupted analysis.

**Model Fallback**
Automatically tries alternative Gemini models if the primary model fails, maximizing success rate.

### Security & Validation

**Input Sanitization**
All external data is validated and sanitized at entry points, preventing injection attacks.

**Sender Verification**
Message handlers verify sender origin, accepting only messages from extension pages.

**API Key Protection**
Keys are stored securely in Chrome's sync storage, never logged or transmitted except to official endpoints.

**Minimal Permissions**
The extension requests only the `storage` permission. No access to browsing history, tabs, or personal data.

## 🛠️ Architecture Deep Dive

### Modular Design Pattern

The codebase strictly adheres to the **Single Responsibility Principle** with maximum modularity:

```
extension/
├── api/                    # External API integrations (isolated, fault-tolerant)
│   ├── core/              # Shared infrastructure (HTTP client, rate limiter, error handler)
│   ├── gemini.js          # Gemini AI integration
│   ├── tmdb.js            # TMDB API wrapper
│   ├── igdb.js            # IGDB API wrapper
│   └── ...                # 15+ API wrappers
├── background/            # Service worker (Manifest V3)
│   ├── handlers/          # Message handlers (analyze, transcribe, settings)
│   ├── security/          # Input validation, sender verification
│   └── utils/             # API key management, keep-alive
├── content/               # Content scripts (YouTube page injection)
│   ├── ui/                # Widget, timeline, markers, legend
│   ├── segments/          # Segment detection, auto-skip, timeline
│   └── transcript/        # Transcript extraction strategies
├── services/              # Business logic (context manager, storage, segments)
│   ├── context-manager.js # Orchestrates parallel API calls
│   ├── storage/           # Video cache, history, transcript storage
│   └── segments/          # Rule engine, classification, detection
├── options/               # Settings page
├── popup/                 # Extension popup
├── sidepanel/             # Side panel (chat interface)
└── utils/                 # Shared utilities (shortcuts, logging)
```

### Concurrency Model

**Context Manager** (`services/context-manager.js`)
Orchestrates parallel data gathering:

```javascript
const results = await Promise.allSettled([
    fetchFromTMDB(title),
    fetchFromIGDB(title),
    fetchFromNewsData(title),
    fetchFromSemanticScholar(title),
    fetchFromWikidata(title),
    // ... 10+ concurrent requests
]);
```

Each API call is wrapped in a fault-tolerant wrapper that:

1. Checks if API key exists (if required)
2. Executes the request with timeout
3. Retries on transient failures
4. Returns `null` on error (graceful degradation)
5. Never throws exceptions that would break the entire flow

### Transcript Extraction Strategies

The extension employs multiple strategies to extract video transcripts, attempting each in sequence until one succeeds:

1. **YouTube Direct Strategy** - Extracts from YouTube's internal API
2. **DOM Strategy** - Parses transcript from YouTube's DOM
3. **XHR Interception Strategy** - Intercepts YouTube's network requests
4. **Invidious Strategy** - Fetches from Invidious API
5. **Piped Strategy** - Fetches from Piped API

This multi-strategy approach ensures maximum reliability across different video types and YouTube UI variations.

### Segment Classification

**Rule Engine** (`services/segments/rule-engine.js`)
Classifies video segments using pattern matching:

-   **Sponsor Detection** - Keywords: "sponsor", "promo code", "discount"
-   **Intro Detection** - First 30 seconds, common intro patterns
-   **Outro Detection** - Last 30 seconds, "thanks for watching"
-   **Interaction Reminder** - "like", "subscribe", "notification bell"
-   **Self Promotion** - Creator's own products/services
-   **Unpaid Promotion** - Charity, friend shout-outs

Rules are modular and extensible. New rules can be added without modifying core logic.
